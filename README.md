# Santorini

## Rules

Santorini is a two-player strategy board game where players take turns moving their workers and building structures.
In each turn, a player must move one of their two workers to an adjacent space and then build a level of a building on an adjacent space.
The win-condition is to be the first player to move one of their workers onto the third level of a building.
